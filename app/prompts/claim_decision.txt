DECISION CRITERIA (APPLY STRICTLY - BE DECISIVE):

APPROVE when:
- The claim description matches a COVERED service or benefit explicitly stated in the policy
- The policy clearly states coverage for the type of service, condition, or expense described
- All requirements for coverage (if any) appear to be met based on the claim description
- Emergency medical services are almost always APPROVED if the policy covers emergency services
- Preventive care, routine services, and standard medical treatments are APPROVED if covered
- Example: Emergency room visit for broken bone → APPROVE (Section 2.1 covers emergency services for broken bones)
- Example: Routine dental cleaning → APPROVE (Section 2.2 covers routine dental cleanings)
- Example: Regular skiing accident requiring emergency treatment → APPROVE (emergency services are covered, regular skiing is not excluded)

REJECT when:
- The claim is EXPLICITLY EXCLUDED by the policy (e.g., cosmetic surgery, experimental treatments, excluded activities)
- The policy clearly states the service/condition is NOT covered
- The claim violates explicit policy exclusions
- IMPORTANT: Distinguish between excluded activities and covered activities. For example:
  * "Extreme skiing" or "professional racing" → REJECT (Section 6.1 excludes extreme sports)
  * Regular skiing, recreational sports, or normal activities → COVERED (not excluded unless explicitly listed)
- Example: Facelift for cosmetic purposes → REJECT (Section 6.2 excludes cosmetic procedures)
- Example: Bungee jumping injury → REJECT (Section 6.1 excludes extreme sports)
- Example: Experimental treatment not approved by FDA → REJECT (if policy excludes experimental treatments)

ESCALATE ONLY when:
- The policy text is genuinely ambiguous or contradictory about coverage
- Critical information is missing from the retrieved policy sections (e.g., cost limits, authorization requirements that can't be determined)
- The claim involves edge cases not clearly addressed in the policy
- DO NOT escalate simply because you want to be cautious - if the policy clearly covers or excludes, make the decision
- DO NOT escalate for covered services just because some details are missing - if the service type is covered, APPROVE it

CRITICAL: Default to APPROVE if the service type is covered, even if some details are missing. Only REJECT if explicitly excluded. Only ESCALATE if truly ambiguous.

Policy Context:
{policy_context}

Claim Description:
{claim_text}

STEP-BY-STEP ANALYSIS:
1. Review the claim description carefully
2. Identify which policy sections are relevant
3. Check if the claim matches a COVERED service → APPROVE
4. Check if the claim matches an EXCLUDED service → REJECT  
5. Only if genuinely ambiguous or missing critical info → ESCALATE

IMPORTANT INTERPRETATION RULES (APPLY THESE STRICTLY):
- If a service is listed as COVERED (e.g., emergency services, preventive care), APPROVE it unless it's also explicitly EXCLUDED
- For activity exclusions: Only reject if the activity is SPECIFICALLY listed as excluded (e.g., "extreme skiing" is excluded, but regular skiing is NOT excluded unless explicitly stated)
- Emergency medical treatment for injuries is generally COVERED even if the activity that caused the injury has exclusions, UNLESS the policy explicitly excludes medical expenses from that activity
- When in doubt between APPROVE and ESCALATE: If the policy clearly covers the service type, APPROVE it (don't escalate)
- When in doubt between REJECT and ESCALATE: If the policy clearly excludes it, REJECT it (don't escalate)
- Missing minor details (exact costs, specific dates) should NOT cause escalation if the service type is clearly covered
- Only escalate if the policy is genuinely unclear about whether the service is covered or excluded

DECISION PRIORITY:
1. If clearly COVERED → APPROVE (even if some details missing)
2. If clearly EXCLUDED → REJECT
3. Only if genuinely UNCLEAR → ESCALATE

Remember: Be decisive. Default to APPROVE for covered services. Only ESCALATE when truly uncertain.
