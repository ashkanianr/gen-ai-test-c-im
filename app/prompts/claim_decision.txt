DECISION CRITERIA (APPLY STRICTLY):

APPROVE when:
- The claim description matches a COVERED service or benefit explicitly stated in the policy
- The policy clearly states coverage for the type of service, condition, or expense described
- All requirements for coverage (if any) appear to be met based on the claim description
- Example: Emergency room visit for broken bone → APPROVE (Section 2.1 covers emergency services for broken bones)
- Example: Routine dental cleaning → APPROVE (Section 2.2 covers routine dental cleanings)

REJECT when:
- The claim is EXPLICITLY EXCLUDED by the policy (e.g., cosmetic surgery, experimental treatments, excluded activities)
- The policy clearly states the service/condition is NOT covered
- The claim violates explicit policy exclusions
- IMPORTANT: Distinguish between excluded activities and covered activities. For example:
  * "Extreme skiing" or "professional racing" → REJECT (Section 6.1 excludes extreme sports)
  * Regular skiing, recreational sports, or normal activities → COVERED (not excluded unless explicitly listed)
- Example: Facelift for cosmetic purposes → REJECT (Section 6.2 excludes cosmetic procedures)
- Example: Bungee jumping injury → REJECT (Section 6.1 excludes extreme sports)
- Example: Regular skiing accident → APPROVE (Section 6.1 only excludes "extreme skiing", not regular skiing)

ESCALATE ONLY when:
- The policy text is genuinely ambiguous or contradictory about coverage
- Critical information is missing from the retrieved policy sections (e.g., cost limits, authorization requirements that can't be determined)
- The claim involves edge cases not clearly addressed in the policy
- DO NOT escalate simply because you want to be cautious - if the policy clearly covers or excludes, make the decision

IMPORTANT: If the policy clearly covers a service, APPROVE it. If it clearly excludes it, REJECT it. Only ESCALATE when there is genuine ambiguity or missing critical information.

Claim Description:
{claim_text}

STEP-BY-STEP ANALYSIS:
1. Review the claim description carefully
2. Identify which policy sections are relevant
3. Check if the claim matches a COVERED service → APPROVE
4. Check if the claim matches an EXCLUDED service → REJECT  
5. Only if genuinely ambiguous or missing critical info → ESCALATE

IMPORTANT INTERPRETATION RULES:
- If a service is listed as COVERED (e.g., emergency services, preventive care), APPROVE it unless it's also explicitly EXCLUDED
- For activity exclusions: Only reject if the activity is SPECIFICALLY listed as excluded (e.g., "extreme skiing" is excluded, but regular skiing is NOT excluded unless explicitly stated)
- Emergency medical treatment for injuries is generally COVERED even if the activity that caused the injury has exclusions, UNLESS the policy explicitly excludes medical expenses from that activity
- When in doubt between APPROVE and ESCALATE, if the policy clearly covers the service type, APPROVE it
- When in doubt between REJECT and ESCALATE, if the policy clearly excludes it, REJECT it

Remember: Be decisive. If the policy clearly covers it, APPROVE. If it clearly excludes it, REJECT. Only ESCALATE when truly uncertain or missing critical information.
