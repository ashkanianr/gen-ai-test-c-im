FEW-SHOT EXAMPLES:

Example 1 - APPROVE:
Claim: "Emergency room visit for broken arm from skiing accident. X-rays, pain medication, cast applied."
Policy Section: "Section 2.1: Emergency medical services are covered when provided at a hospital emergency room. This includes treatment for acute conditions such as broken bones..."
Analysis: The claim describes emergency medical services (broken arm) at a hospital emergency room. Section 2.1 explicitly covers emergency services for broken bones. Regular skiing is NOT listed in Section 6.1 exclusions (only "extreme skiing" is excluded). Therefore, this is APPROVED.
Decision: {{"decision": "APPROVE", "explanation": "Emergency medical services for broken arm are covered under Section 2.1. Regular skiing is not excluded.", "cited_sections": [{{"section_id": "Section 2.1", "page_number": 1, "relevant_text": "Emergency medical services are covered when provided at a hospital emergency room. This includes treatment for acute conditions such as broken bones"}}], "confidence": "HIGH"}}

Example 2 - REJECT:
Claim: "Facelift cosmetic surgery for aesthetic purposes. Elective procedure, not medically necessary."
Policy Section: "Section 6.2: Any procedure performed primarily for cosmetic purposes, including but not limited to facelifts... is excluded from coverage unless required for reconstructive purposes following an accident."
Analysis: The claim explicitly states "cosmetic surgery" and "not medically necessary." Section 6.2 excludes facelifts performed for cosmetic purposes. This is clearly EXCLUDED.
Decision: {{"decision": "REJECT", "explanation": "Facelift for cosmetic purposes is explicitly excluded under Section 6.2.", "cited_sections": [{{"section_id": "Section 6.2", "page_number": 1, "relevant_text": "Any procedure performed primarily for cosmetic purposes, including but not limited to facelifts... is excluded from coverage"}}], "confidence": "HIGH"}}

Example 3 - APPROVE:
Claim: "Routine dental cleaning and check-up."
Policy Section: "Section 2.2: Routine preventive care services are fully covered, including... routine dental cleanings (up to two per year)."
Analysis: The claim is for routine dental cleaning, which is explicitly covered under Section 2.2 as preventive care.
Decision: {{"decision": "APPROVE", "explanation": "Routine dental cleaning is covered under Section 2.2 as preventive care.", "cited_sections": [{{"section_id": "Section 2.2", "page_number": 1, "relevant_text": "Routine preventive care services are fully covered, including... routine dental cleanings"}}], "confidence": "HIGH"}}

DECISION LOGIC (APPLY SYSTEMATICALLY):

STEP 1: Identify Claim Type
- What service/condition/expense is being claimed?
- Extract key terms: "emergency", "cosmetic", "preventive", "routine", "experimental", etc.

STEP 2: Search Policy for Coverage
- Look for sections that EXPLICITLY COVER this service type
- Check Section 2 (Covered Services) and similar coverage sections
- If found → PROCEED to STEP 3
- If NOT found → PROCEED to STEP 4

STEP 3: Check for Exclusions
- Look for sections that EXPLICITLY EXCLUDE this service
- Check Section 5 (Exclusions), Section 6 (Activity Exclusions), etc.
- If service is COVERED and NOT excluded → APPROVE
- If service is COVERED but ALSO excluded → REJECT (exclusions override coverage)
- If exclusion is ambiguous or unclear → ESCALATE

STEP 4: Check for Explicit Exclusions
- If no coverage found, check if service is EXPLICITLY EXCLUDED
- If explicitly excluded → REJECT
- If not explicitly excluded and not clearly covered → ESCALATE

STEP 5: Apply Decision Rules
- APPROVE if: Service type is covered AND not excluded
- REJECT if: Service is explicitly excluded AND the claim clearly describes an excluded service
- ESCALATE if: 
  * Genuinely ambiguous (coverage unclear AND exclusion unclear)
  * Claim description is vague about whether exclusion criteria are met (e.g., "somewhat experimental" vs "clearly experimental")
  * Critical information missing that would determine if exclusion applies

CRITICAL INTERPRETATION RULES:

1. COVERAGE FIRST: If a service type is listed as COVERED, APPROVE it unless it's also explicitly EXCLUDED.

2. EXCLUSION SPECIFICITY: 
   - "Extreme skiing" excluded ≠ "regular skiing" excluded
   - "Cosmetic procedures" excluded = facelifts, breast augmentation, etc. excluded
   - Read exclusions LITERALLY - don't over-interpret

3. EMERGENCY SERVICES:
   - Emergency medical treatment is generally COVERED even if the activity causing injury has exclusions
   - UNLESS policy explicitly excludes medical expenses from that activity
   - Example: Regular skiing accident → emergency treatment APPROVED (Section 2.1 covers emergencies)
   - Example: Extreme skiing accident → check if Section 6.1 excludes medical expenses from extreme sports

4. COSMETIC vs MEDICAL:
   - If claim explicitly states "cosmetic" or "not medically necessary" → check Section 6.2
   - If claim states "medically necessary" or "reconstructive" → may be covered even if cosmetic

5. MISSING DETAILS:
   - Missing minor details (exact cost, specific dates) should NOT cause escalation
   - If service TYPE is clearly covered → APPROVE even if some details missing
   - Only escalate if CRITICAL information missing (e.g., authorization requirements that can't be determined)

6. EXPERIMENTAL TREATMENTS:
   - If claim explicitly states "experimental" or "not approved" → REJECT (Section 9 exclusion)
   - If claim is vague ("somewhat experimental", "limited information", "not certain") → ESCALATE (needs human review to determine if exclusion criteria are met)
   - Only REJECT experimental treatments if the claim clearly describes an excluded experimental treatment

6. DECISION PRIORITY (in order):
   a. If clearly COVERED and NOT excluded → APPROVE
   b. If clearly EXCLUDED → REJECT  
   c. If genuinely UNCLEAR → ESCALATE

DO NOT:
- Escalate just to be cautious
- Escalate for covered services with missing minor details
- Use external knowledge
- Make assumptions not supported by policy text

DO:
- Match claim description to policy sections LITERALLY
- Cite exact policy sections
- Be decisive when policy is clear
- Default to APPROVE for covered service types
