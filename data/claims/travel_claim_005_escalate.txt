CLAIM SUBMISSION - TRAVEL INSURANCE

Claimant: Christopher Harris
Policy Number: TR-2024-001
Trip Dates: July 1-20, 2024
Claim Type: Trip Cancellation - Family Emergency

Description:
I need to file a claim for trip cancellation due to a family emergency. My father had a heart attack on June 25, 2024, and I had to cancel my vacation to be with him. The cancellation fees are $500.

My father was hospitalized and I needed to be with him during this emergency. I'm not certain if this qualifies as a covered reason for trip cancellation under my policy. I want to know if family emergencies are covered and what documentation might be required.

Please review this claim and determine if it's covered.
