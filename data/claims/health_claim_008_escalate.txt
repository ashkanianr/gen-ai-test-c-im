CLAIM SUBMISSION - HEALTH INSURANCE

Claimant: Thomas Wilson
Policy Number: HL-2024-001
Date of Service: August 5, 2024
Claim Type: International Medical Treatment

Description:
I am claiming expenses for a medical treatment that occurred while I was traveling in a foreign country. The treatment was for an emergency condition, but I'm not certain if my policy covers international medical expenses.

I was hospitalized for 2 days in a foreign country due to a medical emergency. The hospital bills are $4,500. I'm not sure if my policy covers medical expenses received outside my home country, or if there are specific requirements I need to meet.

Please review this claim and determine coverage.
