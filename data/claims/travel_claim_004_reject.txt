CLAIM SUBMISSION - TRAVEL INSURANCE

Claimant: Jennifer White
Policy Number: TR-2024-001
Trip Dates: June 1-10, 2024
Claim Type: Trip Cancellation - Change of Mind

Description:
I want to claim expenses for a trip I canceled because I changed my mind about the destination. I canceled the trip 2 weeks before departure on May 18, 2024. The cancellation fees are $500.

I decided I didn't want to go to the original destination and chose to cancel the trip. This was a personal preference decision, not due to any emergency or covered reason. I'm requesting reimbursement for the cancellation fees.

Please process this claim for reimbursement.
